There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1010.4'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer. Using version '20240606', found versions: 20170601, 20240606. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1010.4' to 'http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1010.4|20240606'
