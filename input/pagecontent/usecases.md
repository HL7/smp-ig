### Purpose and Need
This implementation identifies and defines the components of an interoperable medication profile for clinicians, patients and caregivers to use for the exchange of essential medication information during transitions of care to and from post-acute care settings.

The communication of health information, including medications, is critical to ensuring safe and effective transitions from one health care setting to another. Medication errors, poor communication and poor coordination between providers, along with the rising incidence of preventable adverse events and hospital readmissions, have drawn national attention to the importance of the timely transfer of medication information between post-acute care (PAC) providers, including Long-term Care Hospitals(LTCH), Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRF), Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF), Home Health Agencies (HHA) and other settings.

About 40% of patients discharged from acute care receive PAC services (McCarthy, 2021) and in 2018 Medicare fee-for-service spending on PAC expenditures was $58.6 billion (MedPAC, 2020). However, little is known about the transfer of health information, such as medications, during transitions of care, including the types of medication information transferred or the mode(s) of transfer used.

#### Patient Medication Safety
The exchange of patient medication information during transitions of care, such as admission to and discharge from the hospital, is critical to maintaining patient safety. The 2021 Joint Commission patient safety goal for hospitals to “improve the safety of using medications” underscores the importance of this care process. To meet this goal, the Joint Commission emphasizes the risk points of medication reconciliation and meeting the standard to “maintain and communicate accurate patient medication information” (Joint Commission, 2021). The standard further specifies “coordinating information during transitions of care both within and outside of the organization, patient education on safe medication use and communication with other providers” (Joint Commission, 2021).

#### Medication Discrepancies
There is compelling evidence to support the significance of adhering to this medication safety standard and medication discrepancies occur during transfers between acute care hospitals and post-acute care settings (Boockvar, Fishman, Kyriacou, Monias, Gavi & Cortes, 2004).
Boockvar and colleagues (2009) examined the link between medication discrepancies at the time of patient transfer and adverse drug events (ADEs) as a health effect in patients transferred between three nursing homes and seven hospitals in New York and Connecticut. While they found that less than 5% of medication discrepancies resulted in an ADE, certain classes of drugs, including opioid analgesics,
metronidazole and non-opioid analgesics, had a substantially higher positive predictive value (10%) for an ADE (Boockvar, 2009).

In a cohort study of 555 nursing home residents who were transferred from the hospital back to the nursing home, adverse events developed in four out of ten discharges. Of the 762 discharges, 379 adverse events were reported. ADEs, among the list of the most common types of events in this study, accounted for 16.9% of adverse events (Kapoor, Field, Handler, Fisher, Saphirak, Crawford, Fouayzi, Johnson,
Spenard, Zang & Gurwitz, 2019).

A systematic review (Alqenae, Steinke, Keers, 2020) about the prevalence and nature of medication errors and medication-related harm following discharge from hospital to community settings showed the median rate of medication error or unintentional medication discrepancy* was about 50% in elderly patients, post-hospital discharge. Additionally, 20% of these patients were reported to experience an ADE after hospital discharge. Antibiotics, antidiabetics, analgesics and cardiovascular drugs were the most common medications reported with an ADE. (Alqenae et al., 2020).
